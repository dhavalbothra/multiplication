# Multiplication for big integers

Here is very basic implementation of naive multiplication (which takes O(n^2))
and Karatsuba algorithm (which takes O(n^(log2(3)))).

Now, it is using vectors for storing numbers with base 10. Further improvments should be
to change base of all numbers which are stored in input vector.
