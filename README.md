# Multiplication for big integers

Here is very basic implementation of naive multiplication (which takes ![BigO^2](https://upload.wikimedia.org/math/d/d/d/ddd68bd29c2494cbe63f203a70e544e3.png))
and Karatsuba algorithm (which takes ![BigO^log](https://upload.wikimedia.org/math/a/f/0/af0bdd77b22562e62e5ba2233558d7bd.png)).

Now, it is using vectors for storing numbers with base 10. Further improvments should be
to change base of all numbers which are stored in input vector.
